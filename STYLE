1) All functions should be explicitly typed, and contain a one paragraph docstring and a one sentence description of arguments and return values.
2) Functions should not be imported from namespaces. Instead, import the namespace, and use the namespace when calling functions inside of it.
3) Tests for a specific file (e.g., file.py) should be placed in a corresponding test file (e.g., test_file.py) within the same directory.
