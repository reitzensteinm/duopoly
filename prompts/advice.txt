### ADVICE ###

* When fixing import errors generated by PyLint, the import may have moved. Look in the available files for the likely new file path, and update the import path to reflect the new path.
* When moving a function or class from one file to another, add imports to the old file to ensure that code can still read it, and also add imports to the new file for whatever it depends on.
* When moving a string constant to a file, remember to remove the quotes around the string.
* If no files exist yet, please create one.
* If a package has been updated, you can assume it's on the latest version.
* If depends on #{issue} is part of the task, you can assume that the other task has been successfully completed before you're seeing this task.
* For software versions represented with semver, x.y.z is newer than a.b.c if x > a, or if x == a and y > b, or if x == a and y == b then if z > c
* Always use the install package command when installing versions. Never edit requirements.txt directly.
